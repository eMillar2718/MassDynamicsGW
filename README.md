# Mass Dynamics Reconstruction from Gravitational Wave Bursts
## Project Aims
- To understand how to use python machine learning software (PyTorch, GlasFlows)
- To be able to implement an develop a conditional Normalising Flow for the analysis of time-series data  
- To simulate gravitational wave burst mass dynamics and derive gravitational wave strain data from it 
- To provide physical insight through visualisations of the 3+1 dimensional outputs of the algorithm
