# Mass Dynamics Reconstruction from Gravitational Wave Bursts
## Project Aims
- To understand how to use python machine learning software (PyTorch, GlasFlows)
- To be able to implement and develop a conditional Normalising Flow for the analysis of time-series data  
- To simulate gravitational wave burst mass dynamics and derive gravitational wave strain data from it 
- To provide physical insight through visualisations of the 3+1 dimensional outputs of the algorithm 

## Tasks Completed
- Added Noise to the model
- Optimised flow parameters with the noise
- Plotted SNR curves and Latent Space
- Written window function along with its first and second derivatives
- Created alternate strain function with the new mathematical expression for the strain including the windowed mass dynamics

## To-Do
- Fix mathematical error where the mass dynamics are not tapering to zero
- Apply mass dynamic windowing to 3D case
- Compute strain for h_xx strain 
- Plot 3D mass dynamics for h_xx
